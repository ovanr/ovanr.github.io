# About Me

My research interests are mostly related to Programming Languages, such as semantics, effect handlers, type systems, program verification and functional programming.
For more details you can check my [CV](/curriculum_vitae.pdf).
I am currently doing a PhD at the University of Edinburgh supervised by Dr. Sam Lindley.
