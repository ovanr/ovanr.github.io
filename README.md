# About Me
I will soon be starting a PhD at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Sam Lindley.
My research interests are mostly related to Programming Languages, such as effect handlers, type systems, program verification and functional programming.
For more details you can check my [CV](/curriculum_vitae.pdf).
